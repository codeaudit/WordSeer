How to install (if you already have mysql up and running)

  Unzip data.sql.zip -- it will give you 2 sql files (total ~800M) one with all
  the non-user data (i.e. no usernames + passwords), and the other will 
  just create an empty users table so the app doesn't break.

  Look at the beginning of src/php/dbsetup.php: the default value for the
  DB name, (and associated username and password) is "narratives", change
  this to whatever you want.

  Create a new DB with your chosen name, and import the data into it.

  Create a new user with your chosen username and password, and make sure it's
  able to (at least) read, write, insert and delete. Not the most secure thing 
  in the world, I should have used 2 users, so backup frequently.

  Make sure you're able to execute simple queries.

  You know it's worked successfully when you load up WordSeer from localhost
  and it displays a randomly selected sentence from the narratives.


PLEASE  NOTE
  In order to actually use WordSeer like on bebop.berkeley.edu/wordseer
  you need to have placed the top level directory (i.e. the one containing
  index.php) in a place where your server can serve it up, and has permission
  to run php. In other words, you need to be able to get to it through the http
  server and not through looking at the files via file://path/to/file
  The reason is that 1. the php won't run if it doesn't go through a server
  2. browser security restrictions prevent you from fetching json data
